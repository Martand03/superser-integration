1. Get Superset
git clone https://github.com/apache/superset

2. Start the latest official release of Superset
# Enter the repository you just cloned
$ cd superset

# Set the repo to the state associated with the latest official version
$ git checkout tags/5.0.0

# Fire up Superset using Docker Compose
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-image-tag.yml up


This may take a moment as Docker Compose will fetch the underlying container images and will load up some examples. Once all containers are downloaded and the output settles, you're ready to log in.

⚠️ If you get an error message like validating superset\docker-compose-image-tag.yml: services.superset-worker-beat.env_file.0 must be a string, you need to update your version of docker-compose. Note that docker-compose is on the path to deprecation and you should now use docker compose instead.

3. Log into Superset
Now head over to http://localhost:8088 and log in with the default created account:

username: admin
password: admin
